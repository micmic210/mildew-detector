        "Powdery mildew is a widespread fungal disease that affects a variety of plants, "
        "manifesting as **light grey or white powdery spots** primarily on leaves but also "
        "on stems, flowers, and fruits. These spots gradually spread, covering entire leaves, "
        "particularly targeting new plant growth.\n\n"
        "While not typically fatal, **untreated powdery mildew can severely impact plant health** "
        "by restricting access to water and nutrients. Common symptoms include:\n"
        "- **Yellowing and curling leaves**\n"
        "- **Weakened plant growth**\n"
        "- **Reduced blooming and slowed development**\n\n"
        "Currently, manual inspection of each **cherry tree** takes approximately **30 minutes per tree**, "
        "with an **additional minute for treatment** when necessary. Given the vast number of trees "
        "across multiple farms, this **manual approach is impractical**. To streamline the process, "
        "the IT team has proposed a **machine learning (ML) system** capable of detecting powdery mildew "
        "instantly using **leaf images**. If successful, this technology could be expanded to **other crops**."
