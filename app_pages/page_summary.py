        f"Farmy & Foods, a leading agricultural company, faces challenges in "
        f"managing **powdery mildew outbreaks** in its cherry plantations. "
        f"Currently, mildew detection relies on a **manual inspection "
        f"process**, requiring **30 minutes per tree**, making it "
        f"**time-consuming and impractical** for thousands of trees across "
        f"multiple farms.\n\n"
        f"To improve efficiency, the **IT and Innovation team** has proposed "
        f"an **ML-powered detection system** that instantly classifies cherry "
        f"leaves as **healthy or infected** using **image analysis**. "
        f"This solution aims to **reduce inspection time** and could be "
        f"expanded to other crops if successful. The dataset consists of "
        f"**cherry leaf images** collected from Farmy & Foods' plantations."
