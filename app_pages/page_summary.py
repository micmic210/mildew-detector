        f"This solution aims to **reduce inspection time** and could be expanded to other crops if successful. "

        **This project addresses three key business requirements:**
        
        - **1. Differentiate** between **healthy cherry leaves** and those affected by powdery mildew.
        - **2. Develop an AI model** to **predict whether a given leaf is healthy or infected.**
        - **3. Generate a detailed prediction report** whenever the mildew detection model is used.  
        This report will provide **insights into the classification results**, offering **transparency and actionable data** for farm management decisions.
