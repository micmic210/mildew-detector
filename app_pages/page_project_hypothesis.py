    # Hypothesis 1
    st.write("### 🟢 Hypothesis 1: Visual Differences Exist")
    st.success(
        "Healthy cherry leaves have a **uniform texture and consistent brightness**, "
        "while mildew-infected leaves display **discoloration, irregular brightness, and fungal patches**."
    )

    st.info(
        "**Validation Methods:**\n"
        "- 📌 **Mean & Standard Deviation Images:** Compare overall color and texture patterns.\n"
        "- 📌 **Histograms of Color Distributions:** Analyze RGB intensity shifts to confirm separability.\n"
        "- 📌 **T-Test on Pixel Intensities:** Statistical test to determine significant brightness differences."
    )

    st.warning(
        "**Findings & Conclusion:**\n"
        "- ✅ **Statistically significant differences detected** (**p < 0.05** in t-test).\n"
        "- ✅ Mean images show **brighter patches** in infected leaves.\n"
        "- ✅ Histograms confirm **distinct color distribution patterns**.\n"
        "➡️ **Conclusion:** Visual differences can be leveraged for mildew detection."

    # Hypothesis 2
    st.write("### 🟢 Hypothesis 2: Machine Learning Can Accurately Detect Mildew")
    st.success(
        "A well-trained CNN model can **classify cherry leaves** with **≥90% accuracy**, "
        "making the detection process **scalable and reliable**."
    )

    st.info(
        "**Validation Methods:**\n"
        "- 📌 **Train CNN Model & Evaluate Performance:** Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n"
        "- 📌 **Confusion Matrix & Classification Report:** Identify false positives and negatives.\n"
        "- 📌 **ROC Curve & AUC Score:** Assess model’s ability to separate healthy vs. infected leaves."
    )

    st.warning(
        "**Findings & Conclusion:**\n"
        "- ✅ CNN model achieves **high accuracy** (**≥90%**, replace with actual value).\n"
        "- ✅ Confusion matrix confirms **low false negatives**, meaning reliable detection.\n"
        "- ✅ ROC Curve shows **AUC score** (**≥0.90**, replace with actual value).\n"

    st.write(
        "### 🟢 Hypothesis 3: Model Confidence Scores Indicate Prediction Reliability"
    )
    st.success(
        "A well-calibrated CNN model should provide **high confidence scores for correct predictions** "
        "and **lower confidence scores for misclassified images**. If misclassified images have "

        "- 📌 **Comparison of Confidence Across Classes:** Assess confidence bias between 'Healthy' and 'Infected' leaves."

    st.warning(
        "**Findings & Conclusion:**\n"
        "- ✅ Misclassified images should show **lower confidence scores**.\n"
        "- ❗ If misclassified images have **high confidence (>90%)**, it suggests **model overconfidence**.\n"

        "it may indicate **class imbalance**.\n"
