![Mildew Detector App](assets/powdery_mildew_detector.webp)

Farmy & Foods, a leading agricultural company, is facing a growing challenge in managing **powdery mildew outbreaks** in its cherry plantations. This fungal disease affects plant health and threatens the quality of one of their most valuable crops. Currently, mildew detection relies on a **manual inspection process**, where an employee spends **30 minutes per tree** collecting and analyzing leaf samples. If mildew is detected, an additional **one-minute treatment** is applied. Given that the company manages **thousands of cherry trees** across multiple farms, this manual approach is **time-consuming and not scalable**. 

To address this inefficiency, the **IT and Innovation team** has proposed an **ML-powered solution** that can instantly determine whether a cherry leaf is healthy or infected based on **image analysis**. This automated detection system aims to **significantly reduce inspection time** and, if successful, could be expanded to other crops facing similar pest and disease challenges. The dataset consists of **cherry leaf images** collected directly from Farmy & Foods' plantations, ensuring a robust foundation for model training and evaluation.

- **Healthy leaves**
- **Leaves with powdery mildew**

- **Dataset Source**: [Cherry Leaves Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/codeinstitute/cherry-leaves)
- **Dataset Size**: 4208 images

---

## **Hypotheses and Validation** 

### **Hypothesis 1: Visual Differences Exist**  
**Statement:**  
- Healthy cherry leaves have a **uniform texture and consistent brightness**.  
- Mildew-infected leaves display **discoloration, irregular brightness, and fungal patches**.  

### **Validation Method**  
| **Method** | **Reasoning** | **Success Criteria** |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Mean & Standard Deviation Images** | Compare overall color and texture patterns in both classes. | Observable color/texture differences. |
| **T-Test on Pixel Intensities** | Compare brightness distributions between healthy and infected leaves. If p-value < 0.05, differences are statistically significant. | **p < 0.05** confirms that brightness is a distinguishing factor. |
| **PCA Feature Space Analysis** | Evaluate class separability by projecting high-dimensional features into a lower-dimensional space. | Clear clustering of Healthy vs. Infected leaves in PCA visualization. |

### **Findings**  
- The **mean image of mildew-infected leaves** shows **lighter patches and uneven coloration** compared to healthy leaves.  
- **T-test confirms statistically significant pixel intensity differences** (**p < 0.05**) between classes.  
- **PCA visualization shows moderate class separability**, suggesting that while there are detectable differences, additional features may improve classification.  

### **Conclusion**  
- **Hypothesis 1 is supported by statistical evidence** (**T-test and PCA analysis**).  
- **Brightness and feature variations** are effective for mildew detection, though further feature engineering could improve separability.

### Hypothesis 2: Machine Learning Can Accurately Detect Mildew  
**Statement:**  
A well-trained CNN model can **classify cherry leaves** with **‚â•90% accuracy**, making the detection process **scalable and reliable**.

### Validation Method  
| Method | Reasoning | Success Criteria |
|--------|----------|-----------------|
| **Train CNN Model & Evaluate Performance** | Assess CNN classification performance with accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall. | Accuracy ‚â• 90%, High recall for infected leaves. |
| **Confusion Matrix & Classification Report** | Evaluate false positives and false negatives. If recall is low, model tuning is needed. | Recall ‚â• 85% for infected leaves. |
| **ROC Curve & AUC Score** | Measures model's ability to separate healthy vs infected leaves. Higher AUC = better model. | AUC ‚â• 0.90. |

### Findings  
- CNN model achieves **X% accuracy** (replace with real value).  
- **Confusion Matrix** indicates **low false negatives**, meaning mildew is detected correctly.  
- **ROC Curve shows AUC of Y** (replace with real value) ‚Üí model performs well.  

**Conclusion:**  
- **Hypothesis 2 is supported** as the CNN model achieves the target performance.  
- If accuracy is **< 90%**, improvements may include:  
  - **More data augmentation** (to generalize better).  
  - **Tuning dropout rates & batch size**.  
  - **Adjusting probability thresholds for better recall.**

---

### **Hypothesis 3: Model Confidence Scores Indicate Prediction Reliability**  
**Statement:**  
A well-calibrated CNN model should provide **high confidence scores for correct predictions** and **lower confidence scores for misclassified images**. If misclassified images have **high confidence scores (>90%)**, it may indicate overconfidence, requiring threshold tuning.

### **Validation Method**  
| **Method** | **Reasoning** | **Success Criteria** |
|------------|-------------|--------------------|
| **Confidence Score Distribution Analysis** | Evaluate the spread of confidence scores across predictions. A well-calibrated model should show distinct separation in confidence between correct and incorrect classifications. | Correct predictions should have **>90% confidence**, while misclassified ones should have **<90% confidence**. |
| **Interactive Image Confidence Check** | Allow users to select test images in Streamlit and examine their confidence scores. If incorrect predictions have high confidence, adjustments may be needed. | Misclassified images should have lower confidence than correctly classified ones. |
| **Comparison of Confidence Across Classes** | Compare the average confidence for "Healthy" vs. "Infected" images to identify potential bias in predictions. | No extreme bias (e.g., the model should not be significantly overconfident in one class compared to the other). |

### **Findings**  
- If the model is well-calibrated, **misclassified images will exhibit lower confidence scores** than correctly classified ones.  
- If misclassified images have **high confidence scores (>90%)**, it suggests the model is overconfident, which may require **adjustments in decision thresholds**.  
- If the model shows **overconfidence in one class (e.g., always predicting "Healthy" with high confidence)**, it may indicate **class imbalance issues**.  

### **Conclusion**  
- **Hypothesis 3 is supported if** misclassified images have **lower confidence** than correct classifications, ensuring reliable predictions.  
- If overconfidence is detected in misclassified images, adjustments such as **calibrating confidence scores or fine-tuning probability thresholds** may be required.

   - Each class prediction is **independent**, which works well but limits scalability for multi-class extensions.

2. **Softmax-Based CNN**  
   - Considered as a scalable alternative, enabling **multi-class classification** while maintaining **strong binary classification performance**.  
   - Ensures that the **sum of all class probabilities equals 1**, making confidence interpretation more intuitive.  
   - Demonstrated **high accuracy (~99.5%)** with better generalization.

3. **MobileNetV2**  
   - A lightweight architecture widely used in **image classification** tasks.  
   - Optimized for **efficiency and deployment**, making it a strong candidate.  
   - However, performance was slightly lower compared to the custom Softmax CNN model.

### Model Selection Process
