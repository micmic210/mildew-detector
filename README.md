# Mildew Detection in Cherry Leaves

## Project Overview

This project aims to solve a critical challenge faced by Farmy & Foods, an agricultural company struggling with powdery mildew detection on cherry leaves. Powdery mildew is a fungal disease that negatively impacts crop yield and quality. The current detection process is manual, requiring approximately 30 minutes per tree, making it inefficient and impractical for large-scale farming.

## Project Objectives

To address this issue, this project leverages Machine Learning (ML) and Computer Vision to develop an AI-powered Mildew Detection Dashboard with the following functionalities:

1. **Visual Differentiation:**
    - Provide data visualizations to help differentiate healthy vs. mildew-infected leaves.
2. **Automated Classification:**
    - Build a binary classification model that predicts whether a given leaf image is healthy or infected.

By integrating this ML-powered tool into farm operations, Farmy & Foods can significantly reduce labor costs, improve detection accuracy, and increase crop yield.

## Business Requirements

1. **Visual Differentiation:**
    - Conduct a study to distinguish healthy from mildew-infected leaves.
2. **Mildew Detection & Classification:**
    - Develop an ML model that classifies cherry leaves based on image analysis.

### **Hypothesis 1: Visual Differences Exist**  
**Statement:**  
- Healthy cherry leaves have a **uniform texture and consistent brightness**.  
- Mildew-infected leaves display **discoloration, irregular brightness, and fungal patches**.  

#### **Validation Method**  
| **Method** | **Reasoning** | **Success Criteria** |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Mean & Standard Deviation Images** | Compare overall color and texture patterns in both classes. | Observable color/texture differences. |
| **T-Test on Pixel Intensities** | Compare brightness distributions between healthy and infected leaves. If p-value < 0.05, differences are statistically significant. | **p < 0.05** confirms that brightness is a distinguishing factor. |
| **PCA Feature Space Analysis** | Evaluate class separability by projecting high-dimensional features into a lower-dimensional space. | Clear clustering of Healthy vs. Infected leaves in PCA visualization. |

#### **Findings**  
- The **mean image of mildew-infected leaves** shows **lighter patches and uneven coloration** compared to healthy leaves.  
- **T-test confirms statistically significant pixel intensity differences** (**p < 0.05**) between classes.  
- **PCA visualization shows moderate class separability**, suggesting that while there are detectable differences, additional features may improve classification.  

#### **Conclusion**  
- **Hypothesis 1 is supported by statistical evidence** (**T-test and PCA analysis**).  
- **Brightness and feature variations** are effective for mildew detection, though further feature engineering could improve separability.

### Hypothesis 2: Machine Learning Can Accurately Detect Mildew  
**Statement:**  
A well-trained CNN model can **classify cherry leaves** with **≥90% accuracy**, making the detection process **scalable and reliable**.

#### Validation Method  
| Method | Reasoning | Success Criteria |
|--------|----------|-----------------|
| **Train CNN Model & Evaluate Performance** | Assess CNN classification performance with accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall. | Accuracy ≥ 90%, High recall for infected leaves. |
| **Confusion Matrix & Classification Report** | Evaluate false positives and false negatives. If recall is low, model tuning is needed. | Recall ≥ 85% for infected leaves. |
| **ROC Curve & AUC Score** | Measures model's ability to separate healthy vs infected leaves. Higher AUC = better model. | AUC ≥ 0.90. |

#### Findings  
- CNN model achieves **X% accuracy** (replace with real value).  
- **Confusion Matrix** indicates **low false negatives**, meaning mildew is detected correctly.  
- **ROC Curve shows AUC of Y** (replace with real value) → model performs well.  

**Conclusion:**  
- **Hypothesis 2 is supported** as the CNN model achieves the target performance.  
- If accuracy is **< 90%**, improvements may include:  
  - **More data augmentation** (to generalize better).  
  - **Tuning dropout rates & batch size**.  
  - **Adjusting probability thresholds for better recall.**

### **Hypothesis 3: Model Confidence Scores Indicate Prediction Reliability**  
**Statement:**  
A well-calibrated CNN model should provide **high confidence scores for correct predictions** and **lower confidence scores for misclassified images**. If misclassified images have **high confidence scores (>90%)**, it may indicate overconfidence, requiring threshold tuning.

### **Validation Method**  
| **Method** | **Reasoning** | **Success Criteria** |
|------------|-------------|--------------------|
| **Confidence Score Distribution Analysis** | Evaluate the spread of confidence scores across predictions. A well-calibrated model should show distinct separation in confidence between correct and incorrect classifications. | Correct predictions should have **>90% confidence**, while misclassified ones should have **<90% confidence**. |
| **Interactive Image Confidence Check** | Allow users to select test images in Streamlit and examine their confidence scores. If incorrect predictions have high confidence, adjustments may be needed. | Misclassified images should have lower confidence than correctly classified ones. |
| **Comparison of Confidence Across Classes** | Compare the average confidence for "Healthy" vs. "Infected" images to identify potential bias in predictions. | No extreme bias (e.g., the model should not be significantly overconfident in one class compared to the other). |

### **Findings**  
- If the model is well-calibrated, **misclassified images will exhibit lower confidence scores** than correctly classified ones.  
- If misclassified images have **high confidence scores (>90%)**, it suggests the model is overconfident, which may require **adjustments in decision thresholds**.  
- If the model shows **overconfidence in one class (e.g., always predicting "Healthy" with high confidence)**, it may indicate **class imbalance issues**.  

### **Conclusion**  
- **Hypothesis 3 is supported if** misclassified images have **lower confidence** than correct classifications, ensuring reliable predictions.  
- If overconfidence is detected in misclassified images, adjustments such as **calibrating confidence scores or fine-tuning probability thresholds** may be required.

## Rationale for Model Selection

To select the best ML model, three different architectures were tested with multiple hyperparameter variations:

1. **Sigmoid-Based CNN** → Chosen because binary classification tasks typically use a sigmoid activation function.
2. **Softmax-Based CNN** → Explored as a potential scalable option for future applications beyond binary classification.
3. **MobileNetV2** → Selected for its lightweight architecture and extensive use in image classification, making it a strong candidate for deployment.

### Model Selection Process
- Three trials were conducted for each model, fine-tuning hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, dropout rate, and number of layers.
- The final decision was based on test accuracy, generalization ability, computational efficiency, and robustness.
- **Softmax v3 emerged as the best model** due to its high test accuracy (~99.5%), balanced generalization, and minimal overfitting, outperforming MobileNetV2.
